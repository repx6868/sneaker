    <h1>12 Tips for Wearing Sneakers in a Stylish Way</h1>
    <p class="author">Written by Arrow Twenty Two Team</p>
    <p>Sneakers are a staple in everyone’s wardrobe — comfortable, versatile, and now more fashionable than ever. But how do you wear them without looking like you just stepped out of the gym? Here are 12 tips to keep your sneaker style on point.</p>

    <h2>1. Keep Them Clean</h2>
    <p>Nothing ruins a stylish outfit faster than dirty sneakers. Make sure to clean them regularly to keep them looking fresh.</p>

    <h2>2. Pair with Tailored Pieces</h2>
    <p>Contrast the casual look of sneakers with tailored pants or blazers for a balanced, fashion-forward outfit.</p>

    <h2>3. Choose Neutral Colors</h2>
    <p>White, beige, gray, and black sneakers are timeless and go with almost everything.</p>

    <h2>4. Don’t Forget Socks</h2>
    <p>No-show or ankle socks keep the look clean and prevent odor.</p>

    <h2>5. Elevate with Accessories</h2>
    <p>Pairing your sneakers with a stylish watch, sunglasses, or bag can elevate the whole look.</p>

    <h2>6. Try a Monochromatic Look</h2>
    <p>Wearing a single color from head to toe with sneakers can create a sleek, modern vibe.</p>

    <h2>7. Cuff Your Jeans</h2>
    <p>Show off your sneakers by rolling up the hem of your jeans or pants.</p>

    <h2>8. Mix Textures</h2>
    <p>Leather sneakers with denim or canvas ones with knitwear — mixing textures adds interest.</p>

    <h2>9. Go High-Low</h2>
    <p>Balance casual sneakers with more upscale pieces like silk blouses or structured coats.</p>

    <h2>10. Play with Patterns</h2>
    <p>Floral, stripes, or animal print — patterned outfits with simple sneakers keep the focus balanced.</p>

    <h2>11. Mind the Occasion</h2>
    <p>Sneakers are not for every event. Skip them at formal occasions unless the dress code allows it.</p>

    <h2>12. Be Confident</h2>
    <p>The most important tip? Confidence. If you feel great in what you’re wearing, it’ll show.</p>
